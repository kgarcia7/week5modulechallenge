# Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler

# Description
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule  
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner  
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively  

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule  
WHEN I open the planner  
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar  
WHEN I scroll down  
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm  
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day  
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future  
WHEN I click into a time block  
THEN I can enter an event  
WHEN I click the save button for that time block  
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage  
WHEN I refresh the page  
THEN the saved events persist
